              "Cozinha da Rose" translates to "Rose's Kitchen," and that's exactly the 
              feeling we want to share with you. Our restaurant is a tribute to the 
              matriarch of our family, Rose, whose passion for cooking brought joy to 
              everyone around her. She believed that food is an expression of love, a 
              way to create memories and connect with people.

              We bring the vibrant, diverse flavors of Brazil to your table, infused 
              with the warmth and care of a home-cooked meal. Our dishes are prepared 
              with traditional recipes passed down through generations, using fresh, 
              high-quality ingredients. The atmosphere is inspired by Brazil's tropical 
              beauty, with a touch of feminine elegance â€“ think lush plants, vibrant 
              pink flowers, and the playful spirit of jungle animals.
            </p>
